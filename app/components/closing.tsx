                It&apos;s been a long journey for us; so much has happened since the last birthday. We are now getting closer, so I can spend more time with you even though we are not yet living under the same roof. Once again, thank you to everyone who participated in this little project of mine. I know this web is not perfect (I am not a developer myself, anyway), but still, I made it with love. I&apos;m really excited to show this to you, and I hope you like it despite being a website like the previous year. Happy Birthday ðŸŽ‚! ILYF munyutðŸ’•!
